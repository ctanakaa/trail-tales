                <h3>Overview of General Topic and Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Hiking is an outdoor activity which is a popular pastime for many in the PNW.
                    Washington's biodiverse nature allows for people to drive just a couple hours from the greater Seattle area to see all sorts of different ecosystems and landscapes.
                    However, there is a lack of easy to access information for people with physical disabilities.
                    Many trails are friendly and well maintained enough for people with all capabilities to enjoy, however a lack of information is something which limits those who would otherwise attempt these hikes.
                    While trails are given a wheelchair accessibility rating, this rating does not account for other disabilities. The problem space we hope to tackle goes outside of just wheelchair accessibility and includes information on all accessibility features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our user-friendly hiking app takes on the challenge of limited accessibility to nature, particularly for those with physical limitations.
                    By allowing users to share pictures and experiences, it fosters a sense of connection to the outdoors for those who can't physically hike.
                    The app also empowers informed exploration through its compilation of hikes with varying difficulty levels and accessibility details.
                    Finally, the ability to share hikes and experiences builds a supportive community where users with disabilities can connect and plan adventures together, maximizing their ability to enjoy the outdoors.
                </p>
                <h3>Identifying an Existing Attempt</h3>
                <p>
                    There are a variety of hiking websites naming the top hikes in the Seattle area.
                    However these websites simply name the top rated hikes.
                    There are databases such as the <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-outside/map">Hike Finder Map</a> and hike finder list maintained by the Washington Trails Association.
                    This list provides information on wheelchair accessibility and grades the hikes on difficulty.

                <h2>App Description</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>
                About Our Target Audience
            </h3>
            <p>
                The target audience is ideally a broad range of individuals who are interested and enthusiastic about hiking.
                Minority groups particularly those who are physically disabled may be limited in their ability to partake in actual hikes.
                However part of the appeal of the app is the ability to post pictures of the hikes you’ve been on so those to can’t make it can feel connected.
            </p>
            <h3>
                App Features and Information
            </h3>
            <p>
                With our app, users will be able to
                <ul>
                    <li>search: Users can search and filter for information on specific trails based on city, or trail names.</li>
                    <li>save: Through the save feature, trails can be kept and organized for later adventures.</li>
                    <li>post: Lastly, users can share their experiences by uploading new hikes to the app.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Users of our app will be able to view information regarding trail names, hike difficulty, distance, and images of notable views allowing the trail.
                Initially, we intended on using an API to grab data on existing hikes for users to view
                (similar to what was done <a href="https://will-carter.medium.com/the-hiking-project-cli-812b486332f">here</a>)
                however many of these APIs were inaccessible, so this app will depend on users manually leaving reviews!
            </p>
            <h3>
                Solutions From Our App
            </h3>
            <p>
                By creating this app, we have compiled information on different hikes that have the potential to appeal to various hiking preferences and interests.
                In doing so, users can stay informed of hikes nearby, hikes to avoid, and hikes that serve one’s capacity best.
                Additionally, with the ability to share hikes, users can organize trails to plan their future trips/days accordingly.
                At the end of a hike, users can post their experiences, and even come back to them based on how the trail was reviewed.
                In short, our app will help users explore, remember, and share their journeys.
