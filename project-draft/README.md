### About Our Target Audience

The target audience is ideally a broad range of individuals who are interested and enthusiastic about hiking. Minority groups particularly those who are physically disabled may be limited in their ability to partake in actual hikes. However, part of the appeal of the app is the ability to post pictures of the hikes you've been on so those who can't make it can feel connected.

### App Features and Information

With our app, users will be able to:

* **search**: Users can search and filter for information on specific trails based on city, or trail names.
* **save**: Through the save feature, trails can be kept and organized for later adventures.
* **post**: Lastly, users can share their experiences by uploading new hikes to the app.

Users of our app will be able to view information regarding trail names, hike difficulty, distance, and images of notable views along the trail. Initially, we intended on using an API to grab data on existing hikes for users to view (similar to what was done here), however, many of these APIs were inaccessible, so this app will depend on users manually leaving reviews!

### Solutions From Our App

By creating this app, we have compiled information on different hikes that have the potential to appeal to various hiking preferences and interests. In doing so, users can stay informed of hikes nearby, hikes to avoid, and hikes that serve one's capacity best. Additionally, with the ability to share hikes, users can organize trails to plan their future trips/days accordingly. At the end of a hike, users can post their experiences, and even come back to them based on how the trail was reviewed. In short, our app will help users explore, remember, and share their journeys.
